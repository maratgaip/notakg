NOTA
=======================

This is a sample music application to demonstrate how to use angularJS in music streaming service. Its basically let users login to system with one of their social media accounts (facebook, twitter, github and etc) and search/play music. (now you can log in with username "marattig" no password)

Right now it supports twitter and facebook for login, but soon other platforms will be added.

All login and chat stuff happens on client side but I had to use NodeJS and ExpressJS for routing and so on.

###[Here is a demo](http://nota.maratgaip.com/#/user/marattig)

##Installation
After you have done with your configuration:

1. npm install
2. node app.js
3. Open your browser and load the URL http://localhost:8080



## TODO
-  [] Add other platforms too (goodle, github and etc..)
-  [] Layouts need some css
